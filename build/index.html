                <td>&#34;we lost a new pup today. He just came off the hauler on Thursday, December 5, 2013 .(didnt have a race name yet) Kennel name was Shorty trainer said Dr. Gregory was going to do a necropsy, but the Dr. thought it was head trauma.&#34; Investigative Report against Kenneth Deacon, trainer, provides more information. According to Deacon, he received the dog 12/4/13 and he has been transported to him by the dogs owner, John Lashmet, and hauled from Kansas by hauler Mark Augustine. Deacon said the dog &#34;had traveled poorly and arrived in bad condition.&#34; He had the dog examined by the track vet on the 4th and 5th, and found the dog dead at 6AM on 12/6/13. A vet determined it was likely the dog died of a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)....&#34;stress plays a big role in greyhounds getting DIC and it wouldnt be a stretch to feel that the stress of the long journey, while not a problem for hundreds of other dogs, was simply too much for this particular animal to handle.&#34;</td>
